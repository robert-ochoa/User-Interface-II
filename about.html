    <h1>Robert Ochoa Jr's 1st Webpage</h1>
        <span>I live in El Centro, California.</span>
            <p>I didn't do this 1st time around because my laptop got 'broked' two days before launch & I did'nt have the funds to replace it.</p>

            <p>I knew I wanted to program for a living when I took my 1st programming class, Programming in Basic. I enjoy the attention to detail that is required to program well. I enjoy the order that is needed. I like a lot of things about programmin.</p>
